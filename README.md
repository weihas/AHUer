# AHUer(dev1.0.0)

## Hello, Welcome to Ahuer  ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

#### This is my biggest project so far, a project for my college. Because I'm learning iOS development, In this project, I tried the latest SwiftUI, so it is actually a pure SwiftUI application as well.

##### I use the Moya library to make network requests and CoreData for data storage. During this period, I kept rewriting and rewriting my project, because I became better every day, so I would rewrite the code I wrote in the past. In fact, the code that felt good at the beginning would find that I couldn't be read at all in a few days. Maybe it's a mess of code like this to you, but it's actually the best I write now.

#### If you have any suggestions, you can submit suggestions. If you find my bug, I will correct them immediately. 

## This project can only run in Xcode with macOS!!!

#### If you also want to learn or modify my code. you can git clone and just run. I am use SPM to monitor Library

And sBecause api is a private thing, I miss it over a private Github Repositories, so If you want to run other code, you must remove AHUerAPIDetail library,  and open AHUerAPI.swift, use  substitution to  run

#### Have fun!
